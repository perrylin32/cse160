        One day, I took my flock of ducks to Psyduck's maze, a maze based on their favorite duck! :D
        <br>
        BUT oh no's!!! It would seem like I have lost my all but one of my ducks in this maze! D:
        <br>
        Can you help me find my ducks by traversing through this maze and locating each duck?
        <br>

        (P.S: Don't tell anyone, but I heard that this maze contains a literal vault filled with ducks o.o)

        Note To Grader:
        <br>
        Add and delete blocks is very dependent on if the specific block the camera is on
        <br>
        and likely will add/delete one of the blocks around you, especially if you panned the
        <br>
        camera beforehand.
